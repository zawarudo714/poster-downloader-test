# Project brief for AI sessions

Read this first. Then read `PIPELINE.md` if the work touches post-production.

## What this is

A print-on-demand operation. Two halves:

1. **Poster sourcing** (built, in production) — a FastAPI + SQLite + vanilla-JS
   app where paid workers claim movie/TV titles from a 101,605-row master list,
   find HD posters on TMDB, and save them into an audit-trailed folder tree.
   The admin reviews quality, flags bad images, approves completions, and pays
   weekly.

2. **Post-production** (built, not yet deployed) — automates what the owner
   used to do by hand on his laptop: run each poster through a Photoshop
   painterly effect, archive it, and upload it to FineArtAmerica. See
   `PIPELINE.md`.

Live at `178.105.34.144` (Hetzner, Docker). The owner is a solo operator, not
a developer — he reads code but does not want to edit it to change behaviour.

## The one thing to understand

**This project will keep growing in scope. Do not make choices that are
painful to retrofit.**

Stated plans, in order:
1. A second niche — **celebrity portraits**, sourced from Pinterest rather than
   TMDB, a different master sheet schema, ~2 images per title, its own
   FineArtAmerica account.
2. **Merge both niches** under one master dashboard with cross-niche reporting.
3. **More marketplaces** — TeePublic named specifically — and more accounts.

Concretely, this means:

- Never hardcode a niche, a source site, a marketplace, or a marketplace's DOM.
- Anything the owner might want to change goes in the **dashboard**, backed by
  `app_settings`. Not a constant, not a config file on a server, not a code
  edit. This is an explicit requirement he has repeated.
- New capability should be **new rows, not new columns**. Pipeline tables
  already carry `project_id` and `target_site` for exactly this reason.
- Prefer a generic mechanism with one caller today over a specific one you'd
  have to unpick later.

## Architecture

```
Linux VPS 178.105.34.144        Windows VPS (planned)         Hetzner Storage Box
─────────────────────────       ─────────────────────         ───────────────────
poster_downloader_web           worker_service/               Processed images,
= the brain                     = the muscle                  permanent archive
· worker + admin UI             · Photoshop (one image        · mounted as S:
· all state in poster.db          per invocation)             · makes account-ban
· all settings + scripts        · Selenium (sequential,         recovery free
· pipeline dispatch               one tab)
                                · stateless, disposable
```

The Windows node holds **no configuration** beyond a server URL and a token.
Script, selectors, timings, templates and credentials all arrive over the API
on every cycle. That's what lets the owner change behaviour from the browser
and rebuild the box from nothing.

## Code map

```
app/
  models.py            All tables. Pipeline models are at the bottom with a
                       design contract comment — read it before adding one.
  pipeline.py          ALL post-production policy. Settings resolution,
                       greenlight, dispatch/claiming, templates, encryption.
                       DEFAULTS is the only place a pipeline literal belongs.
  payments.py          Eligibility + payment runs. Greenlight hooks in here.
  routes/
    worker.py          Worker-facing (file name is historical; URLs don't say
                       "worker")
    admin.py           Admin dashboard, review, payments, users, backups
    pipeline_api.py    Machine API,  /api/pipeline,    node bearer token
    pipeline_admin.py  Dashboard API, /admin/pipeline, admin session
  templates/           Jinja2. base.html holds the nav.
  static/js/           One file per page, vanilla JS, no build step.

worker_service/        Runs on the Windows VPS. agent.py is the loop.
scripts/
  create_admin.py
  migrate_pipeline.py  Schema + legacy import + backfill. Idempotent.
  dev_setup.py         Local dev: wipes and rebuilds everything. GUI + --cli.
DEV_SETUP.bat          Double-click launcher for the above (creates .venv).
```

---

## Running it locally

Double-click `DEV_SETUP.bat` (or `python scripts/dev_setup.py`). It wipes
`poster.db`, `workspace/` and `backups/`, then rebuilds:

- `admin` / `123456` and `worker1` / `123456`
- N master titles to claim
- Completed titles with **real PNG files** on disk (so the admin gallery,
  payments and the pipeline all have something to work with)
- A payment run, a registered pipeline node (token printed), a disabled demo
  marketplace account, and the seeded work already greenlit

The GUI has START SERVER / OPEN BROWSER buttons. `--cli` does identical work
headlessly through the same code path.

**It refuses to run against a production-looking database** (>5,000 master
titles, or >3 payment runs). That check is verified against the real
101,605-row database — do not weaken it. `--force` overrides, CLI only.

**Dependencies are checked before anything is deleted** (`preflight()`), and
`DEV_SETUP.bat` re-syncs `requirements.txt` on every run. Both exist because
adding `cryptography` to requirements after a venv already existed left setup
dying mid-run with a wiped database and no users. If you add a dependency the
tool needs, add it to `REQUIRED_MODULES` in `dev_setup.py` too.

---

## Conventions that already exist — follow them

- **No build step.** Vanilla JS, one file per page, `?v={{ app_version }}` for
  cache busting. Bump `APP_VERSION` in `config.py` on every deploy.
- **Immutable folder paths.** A poster's `{user}/{date}/{title-slug}/` is set
  at first save and never recomputed, even across renames, replacements and
  date rollovers. Downstream consumers depend on this.
- **Soft deletes.** `deleted_at` is set, the row stays, the file is unlinked.
  The audit trail must survive.
- **`ActivityLog` for every state change** — actor, target, timestamp, JSON
  detail.
- **`external_id` is the universal key.** The `0` column from the original CSV.
  It is the folder prefix (`50. Pulp Fiction (1994)`), `MasterTitle
  .external_id`, and the key in both legacy JSON files. Everything joins on it.
- **`Base.metadata.create_all()` does not ALTER existing tables.** New columns
  need an explicit migration (see `migrate_pipeline.NEW_COLUMNS`). The README's
  per-round notes are the precedent.
- **Comments explain *why*, not *what*.** The existing code does this well —
  match it. Several modules carry a design-contract header; keep those current.

## Data state (2026-07-30)

| | |
|---|---|
| Master titles | 101,605 (98,004 still pending) |
| Completed | 3,467 titles / 7,972 live posters |
| Processed + uploaded to FAA | 4,811 images (+4 removed) |
| **Backlog awaiting processing** | **~3,161 posters ≈ 32 days at the 100/day cap** |
| Paid | 12 runs, 7,975 posters, ~39,875 KES at 5 KES/poster |
| Workers | `humphrey` (currently disabled, idle since ~24 Jun), `test1` (deleted) |

Processing stopped 24 May while the worker kept going to 24 Jun — that gap is
the backlog. The owner paused work to get this automation built.

Legacy → DB matching was verified at **98.9%**; the 54 misses are the earliest
batch, live on the marketplace but with no surviving poster rows. The migration
writes them to a report rather than guessing.

---

## Deployment

```bash
ssh root@178.105.34.144
cd /path/to/poster_downloader_web
git pull
# Back up poster.db BEFORE any schema change.
docker compose exec web python scripts/migrate_pipeline.py --schema-only
docker compose up -d --build
```

Full sequence, including the legacy import and the Windows node, is in
`PIPELINE.md` §5.

## Working with this owner

- He wants to understand the system, not just receive it. Explain trade-offs.
- He will ask "what about X" about the thing you glossed over. Cover failure
  modes, recovery and debugging up front.
- He is cost-conscious and picks cheap, simple, mainstream hosting.
- **Anything he might want to tweak belongs in the dashboard.** He has said
  this more than once. Treat a hardcoded value as a defect.
